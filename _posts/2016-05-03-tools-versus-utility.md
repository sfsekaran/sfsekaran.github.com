There's a pattern in the way people grow as developers (people?). At first it's just "I'll try whatever seems fun, or whatever is popular."
Next, it's "This is the right tool. I know this tool well." Then there's "This tool is better than other tools. I'm going to champion this tool."
Finally, you either stay there, in the "this tool is the only tool for me and there is no other tool" category, or you move into the next one: the tool doesn't matter.

Why am I talking about tools? Because programming languages, frameworks, server architectures, etc. are all just tools.
It's not what you know, it's how you use what you know. So--for me, for example--I no longer care what programming language I use, as long as it serves me well.

This could sound like an argument for us to keep doing the same things we've always been doing: "don't learn anything different, because we know these things and therefore will be able to do things with them more quickly and easily."
Instead, we shouldn't restrict our lives because of what we currently know.

I suggest we should try new things, figure out what they're good for, and use our judgement to assign the right tool to the job.

Plus, without learning new things, we'd feel stuck. No one likes stuck, right?
