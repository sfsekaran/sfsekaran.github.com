## New Beginnings

On the recommendation of a friend, I've signed up for an 11-week Machine Learning class on Coursera.

So far, I don't regret it. It's fascinating in a way that I remember feeling back in college. I'd love to get a chance to apply this stuff to real world problems.

## Holy Machinating Machines, Batman!

No, machines aren't ready to take over the world. But with our help, they can learn how to make smart predictions, categorizations, and groupings.
For example, Google's news grouping algorithms are based on machine learning. A lot of things you see on a daily basis online are powered by machine learning. It's important.

Needless to say, I'm excited to learn this stuff. I'll come back here once I've completed the course just to bring things full circle, and to summarize the usefulness of the practical examples to which I've been exposed.
