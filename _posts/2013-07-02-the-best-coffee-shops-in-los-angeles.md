Let me preface this with a simple fact: I'm addicted to coffee, not
caffeine. But definitely addicted.

If you ever find yourself in LA, and you're jonesing for something
lightyears ahead of Starbucks/Peet's/Coffee Bean/etc., then you've found the
right list. Without further ado, here are my favorite coffee shops, from least
to most favorite.

* **Funnel Mill**
  * high-brow atmosphere
  * they have a pricy designer siphon coffee menu
  * lots of interesting coffee choices
  * "no cellphone zone"
  * I'd go back mainly to try the interesting siphon coffee choices
* **Bru**
  * relaxed industrial atmosphere
  * has a loft area
* **ELABrew Santa Monica**
  * small shop, good for on-the-go or lunch break
  * good house blend drip coffee
  * pourovers
  * best I've tried within the Santa Monica music business district
* **Intelligentsia Silverlake**
  * hipster vibe, but that's fun for people watching
  * hard to find parking
  * very extensive whole bean coffee selection
  * obviously, they only brew Intelligentsia-roasted coffee
* **Cafe Americano**
  * small shop, very laid-back atmosphere, great for long conversations
  * downstairs and upstairs lounges
