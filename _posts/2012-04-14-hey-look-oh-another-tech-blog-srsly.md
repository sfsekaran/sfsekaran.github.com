I've been meaning to start this blog for a while. I think I started a
blogger one a Long Time Ago(tm), but like all of my pet projects back then,
I abandoned it pretty quickly.

Lately I've been on a finishing kick. So, here I am.

I've been slowly becoming re-obsessed with Common Lisp, newly interested
in Node.js, and knee-deep in Backbone.js, Rails, and Coffeescript.

Here's a snippet of Common Lisp to test out Pygments.

{% highlight cl %}
(append '(hello) '(world))
{% endhighlight %}

Wonderful.

See you next time, folks.
