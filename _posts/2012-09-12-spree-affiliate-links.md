I've just created a new (really basic) engine for Spree.
Check it out here: [Spree Affiliate
Links](http://sfsekaran.github.com/spree_affiliate_links/). It simply
stores names, links, and images to display wherever you decide (using
Deface).

Yes, it's stupid simple, but at least it's reusable across Spree
installations. :)

Please send me pull requests if you use it and you improve upon it.
